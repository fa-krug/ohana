# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**Ohana** is one Next.js app for a family: calendar, finance, meals, doctor appointments and an
AI assistant. It replaces `fa-krug/family-planner`, `fa-krug/cookless` and
`fa-krug/findmyappointment`; [docs/plan.md](docs/plan.md) has the decisions, what comes from
which app, and the phases. Phase 0 (accounts, families, admin, shell, worker, deploy) is done;
the modules are placeholders until their phase.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev           # Next.js dev server on http://localhost:3000
npm run worker        # background worker (tsx worker/index.ts)
npm test              # Vitest (tests/*.test.ts)
npm run typecheck     # tsc --noEmit
npm run build         # production build (standalone output)
npm run db:generate   # Drizzle migration from lib/db/schema.ts changes
npm run db:migrate    # apply migrations to DATABASE_FILE (default ./data/ohana.db)
npm run setup-link -- <email>   # print a new setup link for an account
```

## Architecture

- **Stack:** Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, Radix primitives
  (`components/ui/`), Drizzle ORM over SQLite (`better-sqlite3`, WAL). Schema in
  `lib/db/schema.ts`, migrations in `drizzle/`.
- **Two processes, one image:** `docker-entrypoint.sh web` migrates then serves;
  `docker-entrypoint.sh worker` runs `worker/index.ts` (waits for the migrations, then ticks:
  `lib/maintenance/cleanup.ts`, the nightly `lib/maintenance/backup.ts`). Long-running jobs
  of later phases (appointment searches, assistant turns, notifications) belong in the worker,
  never in a request.
- **Auth (`lib/auth/`):** passkeys (`@simplewebauthn`, ceremony state in a signed cookie) and
  argon2id passwords; family-planner's `pbkdf2-sha256$…` hashes are still verified and replaced
  at the next sign-in. Sessions, API tokens and setup links are rows of `auth_tokens`
  (`kind` session | api | setup) holding only the SHA-256 of the token (`tokens.ts`). A session
  opened with a setup link has `canReset` (may set a password without the old one).
  `session.ts`: `getAuth()` (cookie), `getApiUser(req)` (Bearer API token),
  `requireAdminPage()`. Password sign-in is rate limited (`rate-limit.ts`). Onboarding steps:
  SET_CREDENTIALS (admin-created account, via setup link) → ADD_PASSKEY (optional) → COMPLETED.
  The first account (`/setup`, only while there are no users) is an admin.
- **Families (`lib/families/`):** every piece of data belongs to a family; members are
  `editor` or `viewer` (`roles.ts`: `requireRole` gives 404 to non-members, 403 to viewers
  where an editor is needed; an `Actor` with `admin: true` is used only by the admin actions).
  A family always keeps an editor. Pages under `app/(app)/f/[familyId]/` call
  `requireFamily(familyId)` (`page.ts`) themselves; don't rely on the layout's check, Next
  renders layout and page in parallel. Admin pages likewise call `requireAdminPage()`.
- **Server actions** live in `app/actions/*.ts` and wrap their work in `run()`
  (`lib/actions/result.ts`), which signs in the user (and checks admin with `{ admin: true }`)
  and turns `AuthError` / `ZodError` into `{ ok: false, status, message }`.
- **UI:** `components/shell/app-shell.tsx` is the frame (left sidebar with family switcher,
  modules from `components/shell/modules.ts`, account menu; right assistant panel, `Ctrl/⌘+J`;
  both are sheets on phones). A module that isn't built yet is served by
  `app/(app)/f/[familyId]/[module]/page.tsx`; a built one gets its own folder, which wins over
  the dynamic segment; set `ready: true` in `modules.ts` then.
- **i18n:** `lib/i18n/locales/{en,de}.json`, `useT()` on the client, `getI18n()` on the server.
  Tests check that both files have the same keys and that every literal `t("…")` key exists.

## Conventions

- Tests use an in-memory database with all migrations (`lib/test/db.ts`), factories in
  `lib/test/factories.ts`, and a software passkey (`lib/test/authenticator.ts`) so WebAuthn
  flows run against the real verification.
- Keep env names clear of Vite/Vitest's: the public URL is `APP_URL` (Vitest sets `BASE_URL`).
- Deploy: pushing to `main` builds and redeploys (see the `deploy` skill and README).
